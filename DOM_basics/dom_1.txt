Is one of the most unique and useful tools in Javascript

You can think of it as a TREE 

                        DOCUMENT
                           |
                           |
                        ELE MENT<HTML>               
        |                                                |
        |                                            ELEMENT<BODY>
    ELEMENT<HEAD>                                        |
                                           ________                _______    
    ELEMENT<TITLE>                            |                       |
    TEXT "THIS IS SOME TEXT"              ELEMENT<p>              ELEMENT<H1>
                                            TEXT                   TEXT "MYHEADER"
                                        "SOME TEXT in paragraph"



Above is a Dom TREE and its NODES...the DOM is a property of the WINDOW object which is the global top-level element that represents a TAB in the browser
NODES have a parent child relationship.

Top most node is called the root node
